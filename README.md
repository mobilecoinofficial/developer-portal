Welcome to the MobileCoin documentation repo! This repository contains most of the content for the [MobileCoin website](https://mobilecoin.com). If you intend to submit a change to the documentation, please read the below structural guidelines.

# Site Structure

The "Content" folder represents the starting point for all site content. Anything above that in the file structure will be ignored, as will any README files within the site content folders.

Directories just beneath the "Content" directory will compile into cohesive sections in the Dev Portal, using the directory structure as a map for the table of contents and url routes to the individual files and folders.

Documents in these folders, such as those in "Overview," "Guides," and "FAQ," will be constructed into traditional documentation format with a linked table of contents. Files will render into html from the markdown, while directories will be interpreted as subgroup headings.

# Markdown, Directories, and Metadata

## Tables

The Developer Portal uses GFM as its markdown interpreterâ€”anything that would render here in GitHub should render on the site as expected. HTML is also allowed. A note that when making tables, please remember to include the heading dividers and that extra line breaks may cause the table not to appear properly:

| heading | heading |

| ------- | ------- | <-- important!

| data    | data    |

## Alerts

Using the following formatting items will render the line as an information block, a warning block, or an error block:

?> this is helpful information

!> this is a warning

x> this is an error

## Filenames

Pages and subgroups will render *in the order they appear in the directory*. For best results, please add a four-digit number to the start of files and folders, followed by an underscore:

**0010_document.md**

This will ensure they appear in the intended order on the final site.

## Headers and Metadata

All site markdown files should include a YAML-style header which allows The following parameters. This will allow pages to better generate their meta tags, and give some more control over the appearance of things.

```
---
title: "optional. Recommended in quotes to avoid formatting faux-pas. A missing title will use the filename starting after the first _ character. Pages will draw this title as an h1 at the top of the document."
author: "optional. The original author of the page, if desired."
description: "optional. text to be used as the description in meta tags and in internal search previews."
hide_title: optional boolean. When true, doesn't render the title given in this header on the page, for when you want to include it yourself.
use_file: "optional GitHub path. If included, the page will attempt to replace the body with the contents of the given document. See *Pulling from External Locations* below."
---
```

## Images and Other Assets

If you'd like to include an image in one of these markdown documents, the usual method will work:

![alt text](https://mobilecoin.com/images/heart.svg)

You can use a local file by referencing it's root path as it would be in *this repository*. The interpreter will create the proper resource directory on the final site to match this one. That means if it shows up in GitHub, it'll show up on the final site! The below image comes from /images/fog.png :

![start with a slash](/images/fog.png)

Images will try to fill the width of their container by default. If a width is given using an html `<img>` tag, the image will be centered in the document. You can attach classes "left" or "right" to the image to have it align to either side. This is also true of `<video>` and `<iframe>` tags.

## Pulling from External Locations

This site is able to pull in markdown content from other arbitrary repositories as well, provided the document you want to include is publicly visible on GitHub. To do so, just include a markdown file with `use_file: [github path]` line in the header. The site front-end will build a page using the local head data and the provided content as the body.

This system uses the GitHub content API to retrive data, so the path provided must take the common GitHub form of `[owner]/[repository]/[path to file]`

For example, to get the [readme for the MobileCoin Foundation's "Mechanics of MobileCoin" repo](https://github.com/mobilecoinfoundation/Mechanics-of-MobileCoin/blob/master/README.md), use the line `use_file: "mobilecoinfoundation/Mechanics-of-MobileCoin/README.md"` in the document header. It is recommended to still include some body content in these markdown files, as it will be used as the fallback content should the site be unable to reach to remote content for any reason.

## Index Card "Shortcode"

In addition to the normal markdown syntaxes allowed by GFM, this site can also insert a card like the ones on the front page using the following structure:

`[indexcard href="path" title="title" image="image path" caption="short description" class="additional classes" ]`

If on its own like as shown above, the site will render an interactive card link. Note that the cards are inline-block elements by default, and rely somewhat on their containers for positioning and horizontal sizing. 

# Homepage and Menus

The Settings folder allows for control over the three menus (main, footer, and social) via json in the menus.json file, and some of the front-page content via the home.md document.

The menus.json file is just a normal json document with instructions on how to structure menu items. Please validate your json before committing, or you will get build errors.

The home.md file can read any of the same markdown valid in the docs section as described above. Note that when combining HTML and Markdown, you must include a double-line-break to ensure the interpreter knows to switch back and forth.
