MobileCoin uses Bulletproofs [link] in client transaction construction to obscure the transaction input and output amounts, while proving in zero-knowledge that the ledger will remain balanced.

Bulletproofs is an efficient (fast) algorithmic approach introduced by BÃ¼nz in 2017 that has greatly improved performance. It is now possible to use transactions with protected amounts without reducing the throughput of the payments network. 

Mobilecoin uses the[Dalek](https://github.com/dalek-cryptography/bulletproofs) library which is the fastest [Bulletproofs][bp_website] implementation ever, featuring single and aggregated range proofs, strongly-typed multiparty computation, and a programmable constraint system API for proving arbitrary statements (under development). 

The Dalek library implements Bulletproofs using [Ristretto][ristretto], using the `ristretto255` implementation in
[`curve25519-dalek`][curve25519_dalek]. When using the parallel formulas in the curve25519-dalek AVX2 backend, it can verify 64-bit rangeproofs approximately twice as fast as the original libsecp256k1-based Bulletproofs implementation.
