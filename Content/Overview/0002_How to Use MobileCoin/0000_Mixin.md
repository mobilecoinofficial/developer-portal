title: "Buy MOB with Mixin Wallet"
---
Buying MobileCoin is as easy as following this guide on how to use MixSwap and the Mixin mobile app. MixSwap is an aggregator for 3 decentralized exchanges that allow you to buy MobileCoin by "swapping" Bitcoin, USDT, and other currencies for MobileCoin. To swap with MixSwap, you need to use Mixin. Mixin is a mobile app with a built-in crypto wallet. Like Signal, Mixin supports messaging your contacts with end-to-end encryption and is built on the Signal protocol.

Send Bitcoin to your Mixin Wallet
---------------------------------

First, you need to get your wallet address in your Mixin app. Open the Mixin app then choose the square icon on the bottom left corner to access your wallet. Once you are in your wallet, tap on the line that says BTC (Bitcoin). This will take you to the Bitcoin send and receive page. Tap on RECEIVE. A popup will appear; tap GOT IT. Then tap COPY to copy your wallet address.

Connect the MixSWap Exchange
----------------------------

Tap on the search icon in the top right corner (the magnifying glass). Enter the number 7000103767 and tap SEARCH. This will locate a bot called MixSwap. You will know you have the right app because you will see a purple bird logo. Tap on the bot and add it to your app. Once you have the MixSwap bot installed, you can access the bot from your home screen in the app.

Swap Bitcoin for MobileCoin
---------------------------

Open the bot and tap the icon in the bottom right that looks like a little robot with antennae. This will open the exchange screen. Enter the amount of Bitcoin that you want to trade for MOB. The only tricky part here is that they do not tell you how much Bitcoin you have in your wallet, so you may need to toggle back to your wallet to see how much you have. Once you enter the Bitcoin amount, the corresponding MOB amount should auto-populate. Make sure that the receive category says MOB and tap EXCHANGE.

While there are a number of coin exchanges and thousands of cryptocurrencies, one of the easiest ways is to buy Bitcoin on a coin exchange like FTX.us or Coinbase.

To buy Bitcoin on [FTX](https://ftx.us/):

-   Register and go through the ID verification process. For more info and detailed steps to how to complete the ID verification process, check out [FTX's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am-oCJnZaug).
-   At the top of the FTX page, click WALLET to deposit some Bitcoin to exchange for MOB. You can use your credit card to purchase Bitcoin directly on FTX. Click the BUY BTC WITH CREDIT CARD button, and now you have Bitcoin in your wallet. For more details, here's an [explainer video](https://youtu.be/8Lnm-ij7Ga4?t=195).

To buy Bitcoin on [Coinbase.com](http://coinbase.com/):

-   Register and go through the ID verification process. For more info and detailed steps of how to set up a Coinbase account and buy Bitcoin, check out [Coinbase's tutorial](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/tips-and-tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-crypto-wallet).
-   Once you have set up your account, a green button will appear to add a payment method. Coinbase will likely make two small deposits to your bank account, which appear immediately. Login to your bank account and enter the two deposit amounts when prompted. Once you do this, the green button will change to say BUY CRYPTO.

There are two sub steps to this last step. First, go back to your Mixin app and click on the search icon in the top right corner (the magnifying glass). Enter the number 7000103767 and click SEARCH. This will locate a bot called MixSwap. You will know you have the right app because you will see a purple bird logo.

Click on the bot and add it to your app. Once you have the MixSwap bot installed, you can access the bot from your home screen in the app.

Once you are inside the bot, click the icon in the bottom right that looks like a little robot with antennae.

This will open the exchange screen. Enter the amount of Bitcoin that you want to trade for MOB. The only tricky part here is that they do not tell you how much Bitcoin you have in your wallet, so you may need to toggle back to your wallet to see how much you have. Once you enter the Bitcoin amount, the corresponding MOB amount should auto-populate. Make sure that the receive category says MOB and click EXCHANGE.

On the address screen tap the PLUS sign in the top right corner to add your MobileCoin desktop wallet address. Name your wallet in the Label section. In the Address section tap the square on the right side to open the camera and then use your phone to scan the QR code on your MobileCoin desktop wallet on your computer. Once you scan the code it should populate in the address line. You may need to enter a memo on the last line to activate the Continue button. Tap CONTINUE and enter your pin.
