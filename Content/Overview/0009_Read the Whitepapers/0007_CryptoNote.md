title: CryptoNote
---
In 2012, Nicolas van Saberhagen, an unknown anonymous author, published the CryptoNote whitepaper describing a new distributed ledger protocol called CryptoNote. At its core, CryptoNote is an attempt to improve on the design of Bitcoin to create an encrypted ledger.

Cryptonote’s one-time addresses allow payments to be received using numerical aliases that are indistinguishable from random numbers for everyone except the intended recipient. Essentially, every transaction in Bitcoin publicly shares the recipient’s pseudonymous address, while CryptoNote ledgers publish the recipient’s address in an encrypted format that protects user data.
