# Cryptocurrency designed to be used.

MobileCoin is an effort to develop a fast, private, and easy-to-use cryptocurrency that can be deployed in resource constrained environments to users who aren’t equipped to reliably maintain secret keys over a long period of time, all without giving up control of funds to a payment processing service. 

In the MobileCoin whitepaper, the project’s creators describe its mission: “MobileCoin is designed so that a mobile messaging application like Signal can integrate with a MobileCoin wallet,” the team described in its whitepaper.
