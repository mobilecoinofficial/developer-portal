### ![](https://mobilecoinstg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/secure.svg)Step 1: Buy Bitcoin to swap for MobileCoin.

 The easiest way is to buy Bitcoin is on an exchange like [FTX.us](http://FTX.us) or [Coinbase](http://coinbase.com).

To buy Bitcoin on [FTX](https://ftx.us/):

-   Register and go through the ID verification process. For more info and detailed steps to how to complete the ID verification process, check out [FTX's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am-oCJnZaug).
-   At the top of the FTX page, click WALLET to deposit some Bitcoin to exchange for MOB. You can use your credit card to purchase Bitcoin directly on FTX. Click the BUY BTC WITH CREDIT CARD button, and now you have Bitcoin in your wallet. For more details, here's an [explainer video](https://youtu.be/8Lnm-ij7Ga4?t=195).

To buy Bitcoin on [Coinbase.com](http://coinbase.com/):

-   Register and go through the ID verification process. For more info and detailed steps of how to set up a Coinbase account and buy Bitcoin, check out [Coinbase's tutorial](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/tips-and-tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-crypto-wallet).
-   Once you have set up your account, a green button will appear to add a payment method. Coinbase will likely make two small deposits to your bank account, which appear immediately. Login to your bank account and enter the two deposit amounts when prompted. Once you do this, the green button will change to say BUY CRYPTO.

You now need a wallet to hold your crypto. You can obtain a wallet by adding the Fennec desktop wallet extension to [Chrome supported browsers](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fennec/eincngenkhohbbfpkohipekcmnkfamjp) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fox_fennec/).

After you add the extension, follow the instructions to set up an account. Make sure to backup the keystore to your computer when prompted or you could lose your crypto assets permanently. You also want to make sure you choose a strong password. Note: Passwords can't be reset, so you need to make sure you remember your password.

### ![](https://mobilecoinstg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/secure.svg)Step 3: Send Bitcoin to your Fennec wallet

Now go over to your Fennec wallet (click the orange fox icon in your extensions bar to pop out your wallet). On the home screen you will see buttons for Send, Receive, and Swap. Below that you will see a box with tabs for Assets and Activities. Use the search bar in this box to search for BTC and click ADD ASSET.

Once you have added Bitcoin as an asset you can go back and hit the RECEIVE button. Make sure the bar is showing BTC. You should see an address that looks like a QR code with a long string of letters and numbers and a small button to copy the address in the bottom right corner. That's your wallet address. Copy it.

Go back to Coinbase in your browser. Click the big button in the upper right corner that says SEND/RECEIVE. Make sure the SEND tab is active. At the bottom of the popup choose Bitcoin for the type of coin. Enter the amount you would like to send to your wallet. Choose a very small amount for your first transaction to make sure that you are doing everything correctly. Paste the address that you copied from your Fennec wallet into the TO field. Hit CONTINUE.

The transfer of Bitcoin into your Fennec wallet may take some time (could take up to an hour). When confirmed, you should see in your Fennec wallet that you have Bitcoin.

### ![](https://mobilecoinstg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/secure.svg)Step 4: Swap your Bitcoin for MOB at 4swap

You can do the first part of this step while you're waiting for your Bitcoin to arrive into your Fennec wallet. [4swap.org](https://4swap.org/) is a decentralized exchange that currently lists MOB. Go to [4swap.org](https://4swap.org/) and click the big pink button that says USE 4SWAP.

![](https://mobilecoinstg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-09-14-at-9.39.19-AM-1024x684.png)

Click CONNECT WALLET (another pink button).  Since you have already installed the Fennec wallet on your browser, 4swap should ask you automatically if you want to connect your Fennec wallet to 4swap. Click CONNECT FENNEC.

Once you have Bitcoin in your wallet and your wallet is connected to a decentralized exchange that trades in MOB (4swap), this last bit should be easy. Make sure the top line on 4swap says BTC (Bitcoin). Enter the amount of Bitcoin that you want to swap. Make sure the second line says MOB (MobileCoin). Once you enter the amount of Bitcoin that you want to swap, the MOB line should auto-populate with the correct exchange amount and the SWAP button should activate and become pink. Hit SWAP.

After a few seconds your MOB should appear in your Fennec wallet. Congrats! You now own MobileCoin!
