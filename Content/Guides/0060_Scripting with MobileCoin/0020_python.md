---

#### MobileCoin Python Package

The [`mobilecoin` Python Package](https://pypi.org/project/mobilecoin/) provides python bindings to the `mobilecoind` API.

It can be installed with:

```sh
pip3 install mobilecoin
```

The prerequisite to using these bindings is to run `mobilecoind`, the ledger syncing and wallet daemon. Please see the
[mobilecoind documentation](https://github.com/mobilecoinfoundation/mobilecoin/tree/master/mobilecoind) for instructions
to build and run `mobilecoind`.

#### Jupyter Notebook

Please explore our [Jupyter Notebook Example Wallet](https://github.com/mobilecoinfoundation/mobilecoin/blob/master/mobilecoind/clients/python/jupyter/wallet.ipynb), 
using the `mobilecoin` Python package to send and receive payments.
